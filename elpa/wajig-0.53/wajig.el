;;; Commentary:

;; "Wajig is an interface to many Debian administrative tasks. Written
;; in Python, wajig uses traditional Debian administration and user
;; tools including apt-get, dpkg, apt-cache, wget, and others. It is
;; intended to unify and simplify common administrative tasks." See
;; http://www.togaware.com/wajig/ for more infomation.

;; I write this package as a wrapper of wajig for Emacs. I love living
;; within Emacs. :-)

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:

;;    (autoload 'wajig "wajig"
;;             "Create a *wajig* buffer." t)

;; Then, simply run `M-x wajig'.

;; Features
;; --------

;; - Ease of Typing

;;   Most of wajig commands can be invoked by typing very few
;;   keys. e.g., in *wajig* buffer, `o' for `wajig show'.

;; - `ido-completing-read' Support

;;   With the power of `ido-completing-read', you don't have to remember
;;   the full name of a package. It is also an ease of typing.

;; - Output Highlighting

;;   Highlight command outputs. Make them look nicer.

;; The Aim
;; -------

;; At first, i thought i would write an interface for wajig in
;; Emacs. Then i found wajig also supports some other system operations
;; besides deb control, such as start/stop system services. Hence, i
;; plan to add more system administrations, in the hope of reducing
;; typing in a shell as much as possible.

;; Important Notes
;; ---------------

;; 1. It's currently expected to run all the commands in a
;;    non-interactive style. So do have the following settings:
;;
;;     - `dpkg-reconfigure debconf', and choose non-interactive
;;     - add the following into /etc/apt/apt.conf:
;;
;;         APT {
;;              Get {
;;                   Assume-Yes "true";
;;              };
;;         };

;; 2. I only tested wajig commands that i tend to use often. Far from
;;    all of the wajig commands! Hence, possibly some functions won't
;;    work properly. Be careful and let me know if you find any!

;;; Change Log:

;; v 0.1 [2005/09/15 17:19:36] Initial version

;;; Todo:

;; - Make output with percentage number(e.g., `wajig update') display
;;   nicer.

;;; Code:
